## 20210520 meeting James Maria Carolin

mistmatch repair: these are Lynch syndrome genes. Microsatellite instability, whih is a feature of colorectal cancer and ovarian that arises from endometriosis. So that is not something we expect to find in HGSOC!


TO DO which gene expression signatures has Ruben been using for his paper? (i.e. pathways_heatmap_orgs.pdf)


MYC has very high CN in both PDO3 and PDO9, but drug sensitivity-wise they are very different. Why?

TO DO do the off-diagonal genes on either side

these are models of resistant organoids

there are some samples that have bimodal AUC
