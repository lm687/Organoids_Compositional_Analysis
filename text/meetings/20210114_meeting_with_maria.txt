Meeting with maria 20210114

- RNASeq: the targets re not the same in organoid, which is not strange because organoids are in a very different environment than the normal tissue
- Stefan did do some analyses on the correlation between highly amplified genes and expression
- there was a 3' bias in 2 of the RNASeq samples

I need to:
- Put everything on google drive again
- Rank: make the blue line darker; otherwise it's difficult to see
- Xeno sample: it's one of the PDO; look it up!
