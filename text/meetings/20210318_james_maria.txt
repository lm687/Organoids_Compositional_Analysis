TO ASK:

all orgs but one are chemonaive. Does this mean that in the TCGA transcriptomics I should be using only a subset of samples?â€¨
fig3 is still a mess


------

how come there are so many apoptotic genes in organoids

about facets plot in GE:
- moderate correlation with copy number states
- mecom is not associated with gene expression
- next thing to do: either across CN signature groups
- james says to include pca in figure 4

update readme

driver file: by that he means a clean script to create the figures


pc1
immune cell lack of expression
a couple of plots showing CN-RNASeq correlation
(james says with cowplot)


s66 and pi3k inhibittion and doxirubicin sensitibity

check Felipe's paper, the predictions of which is that seeing copy number expression has an impact on the patient response

change my CN exposure bit!

add methods for RNASeq DONE
