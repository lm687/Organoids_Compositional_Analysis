- for RNASeq
	stephane had done resistant vs sensitive
	pathway analysis of the DE between resistant vs sensitive
	the analyses from Stephane are all correct; he had the correct organoid naming.

remove PFI from the figure, and keep the clustering from the organoids. remove PFI

only use the without 3' analysis

WGD vs non-WGD: send to Carolin to do pathway analysis too
