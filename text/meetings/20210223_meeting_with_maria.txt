- TAMSeq: panel of genes. There is an excel spreadsheet
	- a subset are HRD genes
- Stephan didn't use the three samples with high 3' bias
- check what Kauffmann DNA repair genes exactly mean. High value <-> good repair?
- compare signatures per cell to signatures per organoid
- bin single cell per 30KB, instead of 20KB, and check exposures
- colour rna seq by BRCA-mutated
- How to discriminate HRD-positive samples?
